# Introduction to ClawCam

## Overview

Information on the size and sex of crabs and lobsters is crucial for effective fisheries management and conservation efforts. **ClawCam** aims to streamline this process, aiding in:
- Assessing population age structure and growth rates
- Evaluating the overall health and sustainability of species
- Ensuring breeding populations are protected, contributing to long-term population stability and ecosystem health

## Key Features

- 👀 **Automated Detection**: Identify crabs and lobsters from video footage with minimal manual input
- 🦞🦀 **Species Identification**: Distinguish between Brown Crab & European Lobster
- 📏 **Detailed Measurements**: Obtain data on total length, carapce dimensions, and abdomen width
- 🧡 **Sex Classification**: Detect and record sex, crucial for reproductive health assessments

## Project Status

**ClawCam** is in the early stages of development. Currently, we are focusing on:
- Initial data collection and automated annotations
- Setting up a robust testing framework
- Integrating core functionalities for species detection and measurements.

_Updates on progress and milestones will be regularly added here_

## Future Work

Upcoming development plans include:
- Enhancing the detection accuracy with additional training data
- Implementing user feedback for improved usability
