# Introduction to ClawCam

## Overview

Information on the size and sex of crabs and lobsters is crucial for effective fisheries management and conservation efforts. **ClawCam** aims to streamline this process, aiding in:
- Assessing population age structure and growth rates
- Evaluating the overall health and sustainability of species
- Ensuring breeding populations are protected, contributing to long-term population stability and ecosystem health

## Key Features

- üëÄ **Automated Detection**: Identify crabs and lobsters from video footage with minimal manual input
- ü¶ûü¶Ä **Species Identification**: Distinguish between Brown Crab & European Lobster
- üìè **Detailed Measurements**: Obtain data on total length, carapce dimensions, and abdomen width
- üß° **Sex Classification**: Detect and record sex, crucial for reproductive health assessments
